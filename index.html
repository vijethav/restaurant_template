      <section><h4 class="title" id="p1">Vegetables</h4><p>Some people follow a "vegetarian" diet, but there's no single vegetarian eating pattern. The vegan or total vegetarian diet includes only foods from plants.Every time legumes like beans, lentils, and peanuts are combined with grains like wheat, rice, and corn, a complete protein is born. </p> </section>

    <section><h4 class="title" id="p2">Chicken</h4><p>Chicken breasts are the classic lean muscle-building protein. Donâ€™t get stuck in the monotony of eating them bland and baked day in and day out, though. You can shred cooked chicken breast with two forks and toss it in a vinegar-based/East Carolina style BBQ sauce for a brand new flavor without a ton of extra calories. </p></section>

    <section><h4 class="title" id="p3">Eggs</h4> <p>Egg Curry ranks high on my list of comfort foods. It is my go-to dish when I want a non-vegetarian meal but don't have any meat, chicken or fish in the house. Since eggs are usually a staple in the pantry, it is also convenient to cook.</p></section>
